# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

The purpose of this project will be to let users who are not familiar with crypto, gain access to expert knowledge and advice in the defi space.

This will be achieved through the mechanism of a shared multisig wallet.

A user will deposit funds into a smart contract which is controlled by expert but owned by the individual.

The experts will put forward proposals to the user and will submit an executable trade via the smart contract. The user will have to sign the trade before the trade is executed.

The experts will receive 5% of the users portfolio in exchange for the advice and 10% of their initial investment insured.
